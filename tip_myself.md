# Tips for myself

> tips I got during @KB Group and @Graph Group.


### General Reading

- 看了现有做法的话想法会受限，没看的话可能浪费太多时间做的还不如现有；

### Presentation

- Crystal clear about **Problem Definition**.
- A **simple example** of problem is necessary for presenation.
- The **shortcomings(fundmental issues)** of existing methods, how bad the problem would be under what kind of situation.
- Initial result is needed in PPT, at least some **coding**, don't make this just hand-waiving.


### Methodology

- A working implementation is needed first, then optimize it, don't consider many solutions first and even worse got stuck.
- Three Prospectives: Problem, Algorithm, Data; if a work wanted, try formulate and improve it in these three.
- Types of Ph.D. theses (from Allen Newell)–not a topic of this talk
  - Opens up new area
  - Provides unifying framework
  - Resolves long-standing question
  - Thoroughly explores an area
  - Contradicts existing knowledge
  - Experimentally validates theory
  - Produces an ambitious system
  - Provides empirical data
  - Derives superior algorithms
  - Develops new methodology
  - Develops a new tool
  - Produces a negative result

- Follow references from one paper to another until you know an area extremely well. Don’t count on your advisor to hand you all of the relevant papers out of his file drawer. He doesn’t have them all! (from Dave Gifford, MIT)
